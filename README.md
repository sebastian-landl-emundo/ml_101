# Machine Learning 101

## Setup
- **Google Colab**: Just follow this [Google Colab link](https://colab.research.google.com/github/sebastian-landl-emundo/ml_101/blob/main/ml_101.ipynb) and run the notebook. This requires a Google account, but has the advantage that Google let's you configure a free GPU runtime, which we can take advantage of for faster training times.
- **Local**: If you are already familiar with running Python notebooks locally pull this repo, set up the libraries with `requirements.txt` and go for gold. I personally like to use [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda/install/index.html) (or [Miniconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/miniconda/index.html)) for managing my environment and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to run the notebook.
