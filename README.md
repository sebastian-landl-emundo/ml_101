# Machine Learning 101

## Setup
- **Google Colab**: Just follow this [Google Colab link]() and run the notebook. This required a Google account, but has the advantage that Google let's you configure a free GPU runtime, which we can take advantage of for faster training times.
- **Binder**: Binder is a platform that allows anyone to run Jupyter servers, which allows you to run Python notebooks. Just click this fancy badge and you'll launch the main notebook in this repo:

- **Local**: If you are already familiar with running Python notebooks locally pull this repo, set up the libraries with `requirements.txt` and go for gold. I personally like to use [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda/install/index.html) (or [Miniconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/miniconda/index.html)) for managing my environment and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to run the notebook.
